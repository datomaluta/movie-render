### Getting Started
1\. First of all you need to clone E Space repository from github:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/datomaluta-movie-quotes.git
```

2\. Next step requires you to run *composer install* in order to install all the dependencies.
```sh
composer install
```

3\. after you have installed all the PHP dependencies, it's time to install all the JS dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

and also:
```sh
npm run dev
```

4\. Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
And now you should provide **.env** file all the necessary environment variables:

#
**MYSQL:**
>DB_CONNECTION=mysql

>DB_HOST=127.0.0.1

>DB_PORT=3306

>DB_DATABASE=*****

>DB_USERNAME=*****

>DB_PASSWORD=*****


in order to cache environment variables.

4\. Now execute in the root of you project following:
```sh
  php artisan key:generate
```
Which generates auth key.

##### Now, you should be good to go!
